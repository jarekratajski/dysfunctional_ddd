# dsnake


This is snake REST server implementation 
made as example for functional DDD talk.

status: Work in progress

At the moment the status of repo is work in progress
parts of the code are unpolished and still show experiments.

You can analyse it, but please do not use it as an example how DDD 
should look like (especially in Haskell). Sorry, I am still learning.

I am getting there - need some time.
If you can help - any issues, PR are welcome.
